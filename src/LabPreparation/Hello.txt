Once upon a time in a land where the sun set twice a day, a peculiar tree grew at the heart of a meadow.
This tree bore fruits that glowed like tiny lanterns, and anyone who dared to pluck one was said to gain a glimpse into their future.
However, the tree was guarded by a mischievous fox who loved riddles and pranks.
Travelers from distant lands would come to test their wit against the fox, hoping to claim one of the magical fruits.
One such traveler was Mira, a young cartographer with a map that was missing its center.
She believed the tree held the secret to completing her life's work. As she approached, the fox appeared, its eyes sparkling with mischief.
